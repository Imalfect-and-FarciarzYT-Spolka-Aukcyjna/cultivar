# AI-Powered NASA Farming Simulator - Implementation Summary

## Recent Updates

### ✅ Completed Features

#### 1. NASA Dashboard Cleanup

- **Removed:** Data Quality and Historical Data cards from Overview tab
- **Kept:** Farm Status, Active NASA Satellites grid, and Priority Insights
- **Result:** Cleaner, more focused dashboard interface

#### 2. Vercel AI SDK Integration

- **Installed:** `ai` and `@ai-sdk/openai` packages
- **Created:** `/src/lib/aiService.ts` with AI-powered game state generation
- **Schema:** Zod validation for realistic weather, crop changes, and NASA insights
- **Fallback:** Simple simulation when AI is unavailable

#### 3. AI-Powered Day Advancement

- **New Function:** `advanceDayWithAI()` in game store
- **Features:**
  - Sends current game state to OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
  - Generates realistic weather changes based on season and location
  - Calculates crop growth, health changes, disease risks
  - Provides NASA satellite insights
  - Creates contextual alerts for important events
- **Integration:** Updated TimeControlTab to use AI advancement
- **Async:** Properly handles async operations in Zustand store

#### 4. Location-Based Data

- **Added:** Location to game state
  ```typescript
  location: {
    lat: 40.7,  // Central US
    lon: -74.0,
    name: 'Central US Farm'
  }
  ```
- **Usage:** Location is sent to AI for contextual weather and farming recommendations
- **Future:** Can be integrated with real NASA APIs for location-specific data

#### 5. Centered Hexagon Grid

- **Fixed:** HexGrid component now calculates proper viewBox dynamically
- **Method:**
  - Calculates bounds of all hexagons
  - Centers the viewBox on the grid center
  - Grid now appears in center of screen instead of top-left
- **Result:** Better visual presentation and user experience

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Add your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
```

Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### 2. Install Dependencies

All required packages are already installed:

- `ai` - Vercel AI SDK
- `@ai-sdk/openai` - OpenAI provider
- `zod` - Schema validation

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
bun dev
```

## How AI Day Advancement Works

### Flow

1. User clicks "Advance Day" button
2. `advanceDayWithAI()` is called
3. Current game state is collected:
   - Current day, season, location
   - All field states (crops, growth, health, water levels)
   - Active NASA satellites
   - Recent weather conditions
4. Data sent to OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with detailed prompt
5. AI generates realistic changes:
   - New weather conditions
   - Crop growth increases
   - Health changes based on conditions
   - Disease risks
   - Recommendations and alerts
6. Changes applied to game state
7. NASA insights added to alerts panel

### Example AI Prompt Context

```
Current Game State:
- Day: 15
- Season: Summer
- Location: 40.7°N, 74.0°W
- Active NASA Satellites: SMAP, Landsat 8, MODIS

Recent Weather:
- Temperature: 28°C
- Precipitation: 2mm
- Condition: sunny

Current Fields:
Field hex-0-0: Wheat | Growth: 45% | Health: 85% | Water: 60%
Field hex-0-1: Corn | Growth: 30% | Health: 90% | Water: 75%
...
```

### Fallback Behavior

If AI call fails (network issue, API key missing, etc.):

- Falls back to simple simulation
- Still advances day normally
- Generates basic weather changes
- No sophisticated insights, but game continues

## Architecture Changes

### New Files

- `/src/lib/aiService.ts` - AI service with OpenAI integration
- `/.env.example` - Environment variables template

### Modified Files

- `/src/store/gameStore.ts`
  - Added `location` to game state
  - Added `advanceDayWithAI()` async function
  - Imports AI service
- `/src/components/SomeGrid.tsx`
  - Updated to use `advanceDayWithAI()` instead of basic `advanceDay()`
  - Made time advancement async

- `/src/components/HexGrid/HexGrid.tsx`
  - Dynamic viewBox calculation
  - Centers grid properly

- `/src/components/NASA/NASADashboard.tsx`
  - Removed Data Quality card
  - Removed Historical Data card
  - Kept Farm Status, Active Satellites, Priority Insights

## Known Issues & TODO

### Bar Charts

- User reports bar charts are "fully broken" after recent changes
- Code appears correct with proper structure:
  ```tsx
  <div className="flex h-40 items-end gap-2">
  	{data.map((value, idx) => (
  		<div key={idx} className="flex flex-1 flex-col items-center gap-2">
  			<div className="bg-muted flex w-full flex-1 items-end rounded">
  				<div className="w-full rounded bg-blue-500 transition-all" style={{ height: `${value}%` }} />
  			</div>
  			<p className="text-xs">{value}%</p>
  		</div>
  	))}
  </div>
  ```
- **Next Steps:** Test in browser to identify rendering issue

### Pending Features (from todo list)

1. ❌ **Date Selector for Historical Data**
   - Create date picker component
   - Allow viewing past NASA data
   - Show trends over time

2. ❌ **More Playful Dashboard Design**
   - Add animations
   - Use game-like colors and icons
   - Make it feel less "corporate", more fun

3. ❌ **Real NASA API Integration**
   - Research NASA Earthdata API
   - Implement actual satellite data fetching
   - Replace mock data with real values

## Testing the AI Feature

### Without API Key (Fallback)

```bash
# Don't set OPENAI_API_KEY
bun dev
```

- Game will work normally
- Day advancement uses simple simulation
- No AI-generated insights

### With API Key (Full AI)

```bash
# Set OPENAI_API_KEY in .env.local
bun dev
```

- Click "Advance Day"
- Check console for AI generation logs
- Look for NASA insights in alerts panel
- Weather should change realistically based on season

### Example Expected Output

When advancing a day with AI enabled, you should see:

- Weather changes appropriate to season
- Alerts like "SMAP data shows soil moisture dropping in northern fields"
- NASA insights like "Landsat NDVI indicates healthy crop growth in 85% of fields"
- Realistic crop growth and water depletion

## Performance Considerations

### AI Call Cost

- Each day advancement costs ~$0.001 - $0.002
- Uses GPT-4o-mini (cheapest model)
- Falls back to free simulation if budget concerned

### Optimization Options

1. Cache AI responses for similar conditions
2. Only call AI every N days
3. Use simpler prompts for faster responses
4. Batch multiple day advancements

## Future Enhancements

1. **Field Data Integration**
   - Currently uses placeholder field data
   - TODO: Connect to actual Plant/Field class instances
   - Properly track and update all field states

2. **Historical Data Tracking**
   - Store AI-generated changes in history
   - Allow time-travel viewing
   - Generate reports and analytics

3. **NASA API Integration**
   - Fetch real SMAP soil moisture data
   - Use actual Landsat NDVI values
   - Display real satellite imagery

4. **Multi-day Planning**
   - AI predicts 7-day forecast
   - Suggest planting schedules
   - Optimize resource usage

## Code Quality

### Type Safety

- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Proper async/await handling
- ✅ Zod schemas for runtime validation

### Best Practices

- ✅ Fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Separation of concerns (AI service separate from store)
- ✅ Environment variable usage for API keys

## Questions?

If you encounter issues:

1. Check `.env.local` has correct API key
2. Check console for error messages
3. Verify all packages installed (`bun install`)
4. Try fallback mode (remove API key temporarily)
